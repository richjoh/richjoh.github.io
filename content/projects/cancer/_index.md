I am interested in how the extracellular environment affects the internal states of cells.  
One of the focuses is how the stiffness of the surrounding matrix.  Matrix stiffness is a
 critical factor deciding cell fate, and the same cells can acquire different properties
on different extracellular matrix.  My group aims to study this question focusing on how
the information of the extracellular matrix is stored in the cell.
 
Understanding this is critical in the tumor progression as aggressive tumor 
cells often invade and migrate into other tissues, known as metastasis 
(Wirtz et al (2011) Nat Rev Cancer). I am using yeast and human cells to tackle this, 
and yeast cells, due to easy genomic manipulation and faster growth, provide unique
opportunities over human cells.  Some of the specific questions that we are interested in are: 
1) how the extracellular matrix stiffness affects the chromatin landscape and heterochromatin
organization and 2) how the matrix stiffness contributes to the tumor aggressiveness.
