I am interested in how the genome organization facilitates
the coregulation of multiple pathways.  This is critical for
cell survival as cells often have to change the gene expression
of thousands of genes rapidly in response to environmental stimuli
or stress.  Previously, I showed that the one-dimensional organization
of the genome is critical for the co-regulation of multiple pathways (Joh et al, under review).  
 
Following up on this, I plan to systematically access 1) if the
disruption of such genome organization leads to the loss of coherence among
well-characterized pathways in human and 2) how such disruption affects the patient
survival in various human diseases.  Also, I am interested in how the 3D genome
organization facilitates crosstalk between different chromosomes.
